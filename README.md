# In-Rust
Rewriting previously written programs to learn the Rust language

### Notes
Most of the rewritten programs were originally assigments for a college course. Since professors have copyright over their written material, I am unable to distribute instructions for most of these projects.  
I also heavily discourage cheating. If you are a student looking for answer, do not copy.
