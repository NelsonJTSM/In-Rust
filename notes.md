## Todo:
1. Rewrite dupey-dupe unit tests.
2. Rewrite DupeyDupe.h
3. (Maybe) Rewrite testing script.
4. Write rust script to run binary using arguments**.txt
   1. Make sure to compare output with ```sample_output```
5. Write DupeyDupe
6. Make sure to test program using valgrind.

## Extra
1. Look into creating better comments for my git commits.
2. Look into [```assert_cmd``` crate](https://lib.rs/crates/assert_cmd).
3. Search how to test binaries.
